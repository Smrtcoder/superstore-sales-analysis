## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data from a large superstore to identify revenue trends, profitability drivers, and opportunities for business optimization. The goal was to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow: cleaning raw data, performing exploratory analysis, and communicating actionable insights to stakeholders through a clear dashboard.

---

## Business Questions
- Which product categories generate the most revenue and profit?
- How do sales and profits trend over time?
- Are there regional differences in performance?
- Which areas underperform despite strong sales volume?
- What data-driven actions could improve profitability?

---

## Dataset
- Source: Sample Superstore dataset
- Records: ~9,900 orders
- Time Period: 2014–2017

---

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets – data cleaning, pivot tables, KPI creation
- Data Visualization – charts and dashboard design

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized date formats
- Created calculated fields for monthly analysis
- Ensured consistent structure for pivot table analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Technology products generated the highest revenue, though profitability varied by region.
- Furniture showed strong sales volume but lower profit margins in several regions.
- Sales consistently peaked toward the end of the year, indicating strong seasonality.
- Some regions and categories underperformed despite high order volume.

---

## Recommendations
- Reallocate focus toward higher-margin product categories.
- Review pricing, discounting, and shipping strategies in low-profit regions.
- Plan inventory and marketing efforts ahead of Q4 seasonal demand.
- Monitor underperforming categories to reduce margin erosion.

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into meaningful business insights and communicate findings clearly through dashboards and written analysis—core skills required for a junior data analyst or reporting analyst role.
